# Enhanced Motion Detection Output Format
# =====================================
# 
# This file shows the new structured output format for motion detection debugging.
# All estimator-related prints are now controlled by PRINT_ESTIMATOR = true.

# Raw sensor data (unchanged)
RAW_DATA,0,1000.2,50.3,-950.8,0.1,-0.2,0.3
RAW_DATA,10000,1001.1,51.2,-949.5,0.15,-0.18,0.32

# Final output angles: altitude, azimuth, zenith (unchanged)
ANGLES,0,1.5,-2.3,0.8,MONITORING
ANGLES,10000,1.6,-2.4,0.9,MONITORING

# NEW: MotionDI euler angles: pitch, yaw, roll
ANGLES_DI,0,1.2,-2.1,0.9
ANGLES_DI,10000,1.3,-2.2,1.0

# NEW: Simple Integration filter: pitch, yaw, roll  
ANGLES_SI,0,1.4,-2.2,0.7
ANGLES_SI,10000,1.5,-2.3,0.8

# NEW: Complementary filter: pitch, yaw, roll
ANGLES_CO,0,1.3,-2.0,0.8  
ANGLES_CO,10000,1.4,-2.1,0.9

# NEW: Fused angles (MDI + MotionEstimator): pitch, yaw, roll
ANGLES_FU,0,1.35,-2.15,0.75
ANGLES_FU,10000,1.45,-2.25,0.85

# Gyro bias (unchanged)
GYRO_BIAS_MDI,0,-0.411,0.587,0.774
GYRO_BIAS_MDI,10000,-0.412,0.586,0.773

# Benefits of New Format:
# =======================
# 1. Consistent CSV format for all angle data
# 2. Easy parsing and visualization
# 3. Clear separation of different filter outputs
# 4. All estimator data controlled by single PRINT_ESTIMATOR flag
# 5. Maintains backward compatibility with ANGLES output
# 6. Perfect for both live and post-processing analysis

# Coordinate System Notes:
# ========================
# ANGLES: Uses horizontal coordinates (altitude=pitch, azimuth=yaw, zenith=roll)
# ANGLES_DI/SI/CO/FU: Uses standard euler angles (pitch, yaw, roll)
# This allows direct comparison between MotionDI and MotionEstimator outputs
